# Character-Level-OCR

A deep learning project for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that recognizes individual characters and short text sequences from synthetic and handwritten-style images using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture trained with CTC loss. This project implements a Character-Level OCR system trained on synthetic datasets generated using the TextRecognitionDataGenerator (TRDG) and EMNIST datasets. Itâ€™s designed to recognize small sequences of alphanumeric characters and punctuation, similar to text seen in handwritten notes or scanned forms.

## Model Architecture

The OCR model is based on the CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network):
- CNN layers extract spatial features from the image.
- Bi-directional LSTM layers learn the sequence dependencies.
- CTC loss is used to align variable-length text outputs with predictions.

## Dataset Preparation

Run this to generate synthetic OCR training data and prepare it for training: python prepare_ocr_dataset.py

This script:
- Creates datasets using TRDG (TextRecognitionDataGenerator).
- Combines it with EMNIST or other sources.
- Saves image paths and labels to a CSV file: datasets/data.csv.

## Training

Train the model using your custom dataset: python train_crnn.py
After training, the model and character mapping are saved in: ocr_crnn_model/crnn.pth

## Evaluation

During or after training, youâ€™ll see logs like:
Epoch 200/200 â€” Loss: 0.1245 â€” Accuracy: 95.38%
âœ… Model saved to ocr_crnn_model/crnn.pth

## Inference / Testing

To predict text from new images: python inference_crnn.py

Example output:
Image: datasets/emnist_images/00000.png
Ground Truth: Z
Predicted   : 2

Image: datasets/emnist_images/00001.png
Ground Truth: a
Predicted   : a
